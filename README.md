# Task_Manager

a RESTful API for managing tasks. Users can perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks, including creating new tasks, retrieving task details, updating task information, and deleting tasks. Each task will have properties like title, description, status, and due date.

Key Features:

Task Creation: Users can create new tasks by sending a POST request to the API. The request should include the task details (e.g., title, description, status, due date), and the API should store the task in a database.

Task Retrieval: Users can retrieve a list of all tasks or get the details of a specific task by sending GET requests to the API. The API should return the task(s) in a structured format (e.g., JSON).

Task Updating: Users can update the details of a task by sending a PUT or PATCH request to the API, specifying the task ID and the updated information.

Task Deletion: Users can delete a task by sending a DELETE request to the API, providing the task ID.

Error Handling: Implement proper error handling and validation to ensure that users receive appropriate error messages for invalid requests or missing data.
